# Security Policy
Our security policy is designed to keep you informed on how to disclose security vulnerabilities and give crucial information on what versions of the project will receive support for security vulnerabilities.

## How to disclose a security vulnerability?
We appreciate the disclosure of security vulnerabilities to ensure the security of the project.

If you have a vulnerability to report, please contact us at [mailroom@discordextremelist.xyz](mailto:mailroom@discordextremelist.xyz).

## Project support
We will only provide patches for the latest project version given the purpose of the open-source project. 

In the table we have detailed what versions will receive ongoing security updates, information on how to patch security issues, and whether there is no support at all.
